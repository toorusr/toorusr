Welcome to my small code corner. Thank you for visiting.

I am a generalistic entrepreneur coming from software engineering.

Unfortunately almost all code I have written or am writing is private. You'll only find some pretty hacky pre-LLM code I wrote 5-10 years ago in this account (please don't judge haha, I write better code nowadays).

Feel free to chat with me via email if you are looking to make money writing cool code.

I write high performing code and manage a team that builds stuff in:

- Python
- Rust
- Go
- JavaScript

To
- Aggregate and work with data at scale
- Solve challenges in M&A and Private Equity
