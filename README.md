Welcome to my small code corner. Thank you for visiting.

I am a software engineer, turned software manager, turned business entrepeneur, turned engineering entrepreneur.

Unfortunately almost all code I have written or am writing is private. You'll only find some pretty hacky pre-LLM code I wrote 5-10 years ago in this account.

Feel free to chat with me via email to know what I am actually doing.

I write high performing code in:

- Python
- Rust
- JavaScript

To
- Aggregate and work with data at scale
- Solve challenges in M&A and Sales
